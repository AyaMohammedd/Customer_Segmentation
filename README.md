# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer transaction data to identify distinct customer segments. The analysis helps in understanding customer behavior, preferences, and spending patterns, which can be used for targeted marketing and business strategies.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Customer segmentation using clustering algorithms (K-means)
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Visualization of customer segments
- Insights and business recommendations

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following key features:
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, Gender, Location
- **Transaction Details**: Transaction amounts, dates, frequencies
- **Product Information**: Product categories, purchase history
- **Behavioral Data**: Spending patterns, transaction intervals


## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - Categorical variable encoding

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Statistical analysis
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualization of key metrics

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features from existing data
   - Handling outliers
   - Feature selection

4. **Modeling**:
   - K-means clustering
   - Determining optimal number of clusters
   - Evaluating cluster quality

5. **Visualization**:
   - PCA for dimensionality reduction
   - 2D/3D visualization of clusters
   - Interpretation of results

## Results
The analysis identifies distinct customer segments based on their transaction behavior and demographic characteristics. Each segment is profiled with key characteristics and business recommendations.
